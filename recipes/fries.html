        <li>First let's preheat our over to 450 degrees F.</li>
        <li>Drizzle your baking sheet with <b>half</b> the olive oil, making sure there is a nice coat on the sheet.</li>
        <li>Next we're gonna clean the potatoes and peel <em>(if you prefer)</em> then slice them in 1/4 inches wide-sticks.</li>
        <li>Place the slice potatoes in a large bowl and pour hot tap water and soak them for 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Take out your slice potatoes and dry them in a towel. We will also empty our our bowl and dry that so we can place our sliced potatoes so we can season them.</li>
        <li>We are not going to season our sliced potatoes with the remaining olive oil, salt, garlic powder, onion powder, and pepper. Make sure that seasoning is well spread.</li>
        <li>Now we're gonna put our sliced potatoes into our baking sheets and place them in the lower third of the oven for 15 to 20 minutes until golden brown.</li>
        <li>We will now flip our fries and bake for another 5 to 10 minutes and then pull them out.</li>
        <li>Now will be the time where we can add additional topping not included on the recipe like cheese, chilli beans, or leave them as is and sprinkle extra salt if you want.</li>
        <li>You are now ready to enjoy your baked fries.</li>
